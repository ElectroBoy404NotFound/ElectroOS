# ElectroOS
An OS made by me
Verson: Beta 1.0.0

## How to compile?

### NOTE: If you are not using ubuntu linux and use windows or anyother OS, setup a virtualbox vm. I will add docker so that you can build on any platform

### Step 1:
#### Clone the repo using ``git clone https://github.com/ElectroBoy404NotFound/ElectroOS`` and cd into it using ``cd ElectroOS``
### Step 2:
#### Setup the build envronment using ``make setup``
### Step 3:
#### Build the OS using ``make build``
### Step 4:
#### The kernel will now be build and an .iso file will be present in ElectroOS/output and its name will be "ElectroOS.iso". In the main folder (ElectroOS), to test the build, run ``make run`` and everything should work!

## Known issues
### More then 3GB of ram for the OS causes a reboot 
#### Status: Indentified
### OS text on real hardware is broken
#### Status: Won't fix
### OS reboots after pressing a key on the keyboard
#### Status: Reported
